## ðŸ”ƒWorking of project
 
- Auth Controller
 
        - Initially Auth Controller starts runs.

        - After submitting the form in index.jsp again the auth controller starts authentication

        - There will be a register button in index.jsp after clicking it, user.jsp page works.
        - Once after submitting the register user controller runs where it will check validation for field required and password match.
        - Finally the index page navigates where the user can login now.
 
- Home Controller
 
        - After login, the datum in the workbence will  be stored in the list using home Dao.
        - I used the model.addattribute and set the list.
        - Now the page navigates to the home.jsp page where the list will be looped and displayed in the table.
